Selion Framework

Selion Framework is a wrapper library for Selenium WebDriver.

The framework aims to help producing test automation codes that are easy to maintain, easy to read while allowing ramping up the development speed. 

The ease to read and maintain the test automation code is crucial to success of any projects. Projects incorporates test automation to cut down on the technical debt. Adding more technical debt by having to maintain complex, inlegible code is exactly what we want to avoid.

The framework promote consistant, legible and manageable test automation code by:
- providing pattern based code that are consistent throughout, making the codes more predictible.
- implementing automatic wait allows the code to focus on things to do while allowing custom waits for those more difficult cases.
- allowing custom components that are reuseable.
